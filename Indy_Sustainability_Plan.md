# Indianapolis Sustainability Plan

**Date:** November 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Mental health, community, and financial rebuilding strategies for life in Indianapolis

**Note:** This is the crucial part of the plan - not just financial sustainability, but mental health, community, and relationship rebuilding. This is where the real work happens.

## 🎯 **THE CHALLENGE: MENTAL HEALTH & COMMUNITY REBUILDING**

### **The Honest Reality:**

Daniel has never put enough effort into community and relationships in his entire life. The increased clarity of mind from recovery has revealed why:

**Every person on earth has a default label in his mind of "threat."**

His brain assumes everyone wants to hurt him, either directly or by taking something from him that he can't afford to give. It takes a LOT to convince that protection infrastructure that someone is not a threat, so very few people have ever made it through.

**This means:**
- Building relationships and community is brutally hard
- The sheer amount of energy needed to disable all the defenses can be exhausting
- Normally calculates that there are other "more important" things to spend energy on
- **But he wants to change this. He really does.**

### **The Strategy: Start with Accessible Entry Points**

Rather than trying to force relationships in high-defense situations, focus on activity-based and interest-based communities where defenses can naturally lower:

1. **AA Community** - Natural community, already comfortable, knows he can be comfortable in Indianapolis
2. **Maker Community** - Activity-based, shared passion (carbon fiber, Linotype machines, old school machining), less threatening because it's about the work, not personal connection

---

## 📅 **MONTHS 1-3: STABILIZE**

### **Mental Health Rebuilding:**
- **Get settled in safe space** - Let defenses come down naturally (not forced)
- **AA meetings immediately** - Find meetings, attend regularly, let community form organically
- **Therapy/mental health support** - Consider finding therapist in Indianapolis (if not already in place)
- **Routine and structure** - Build daily routines that support mental health
- **Sleep and rest** - Actually get sleep (no more methadone-snoring roommates)
- **Focus: Recovery, breathing, being human again**

### **Community Building (Low-Pressure Entry Points):**
- **AA meetings** - Attend 3-5 meetings per week, let relationships form naturally
- **Research Maker community** - Find Indianapolis maker spaces, carbon fiber groups, machining communities
- **Research Linotype/printing history** - Find that Midwest museum of Linotype machines, connect with printing history community
- **No pressure to "make friends"** - Just show up, participate in activities, let connections happen organically
- **Focus: Activity-based connection, not relationship-forcing**

### **Financial Rebuilding:**
- **Uber strategically** (not grinding) - Supplemental income, not survival mode
- **Maybe land part-time work** - Tesla interview Dec 5, or similar opportunities
- **Address debt strategically** - Call IRS, start payment plans, don't panic
- **Track expenses** - Build awareness of spending patterns
- **Focus: Stability, not perfection**

### **Physical Environment:**
- **Arrive in winter** - Short days, ice on roads (but Daniel is experienced winter driver)
- **Get settled in apartment** - Make it feel like home, safe space
- **Basic essentials** - Bed, basic kitchen stuff, minimal but functional
- **Focus: Safe, quiet, peaceful environment**

### **Financial Rebuilding:**
- **Continue Uber + part-time work** - Building sustainable income mix
- **Start proper app marketing** - YouTube Shorts, product pages (now have creative energy)

## ❄️ **WINTER CONSIDERATIONS (Arriving in Winter)**

### **The Reality:**
- Short days (4 hours of sunlight)
- Ice on roads
- Winter weather challenges

### **The Strategy:**
- **Daniel is experienced winter driver** (Finger Lakes, Buffalo)
- **Winter may actually HELP Uber income** (bad weather = higher demand, surge pricing)
- **AA meetings continue** (indoor, regular, community support)
- **Maker community** (indoor activities, workshops, shared spaces)
- **Focus on indoor activities** until spring, then expand outdoor community

**Winter is manageable, and may actually provide advantages for income and indoor community activities.**
