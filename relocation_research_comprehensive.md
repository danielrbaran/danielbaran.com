3. **Jobs:** All three have real tech PM opportunities

- **This doesn't work. Too tight.**

   - "Indianapolis suburbs 1 bedroom under 1100"

2. **This Weekend:** 
   - Narrow to 5-10 specific apartments
   - Contact them via email/phone
   - Schedule virtual tours if available

3. **Next Week:**
   - Apply to top 3-5 choices
   - With Sarah's support, secure deposit
   - Plan move date

4. **Move ASAP:**

## 💚 **THE BOTTOM LINE**

You're in a mental health crisis. You need to move ASAP. You need somewhere:
- **SAFE** (low crime, peaceful)

Columbus and Kansas City are excellent backups if Indy doesn't work out for some reason.

But Indianapolis is the answer. It's time to get out of Marin and get to a place where you can actually merge onto the highway.
